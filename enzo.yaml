          Common issues:

          `est` uses `yarn` as a package manager.

          Learn more about installing `yarn` here https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install

      description: >
          `est` has handy documentation to help you create a stunning website. The project uses
          jsdoc (https://jsdoc.app/).


          To open the docs, run the following command

          `yarn run doc && open ./out/index.html`

          It uses `parcel` as a bundler. Read more cool stuff about it here https://parceljs.org
